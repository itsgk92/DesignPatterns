# Design and DesignPatterns
####About

This is a repository which I use for learning design patterns. 
This is formed as a notes with the book **Head First Design Patterns**
by *Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman*. Although I have also been *googling* a whenever I get questions and put the
answers here :smirk: .

I have also used this repo to learn .md - *markdown*. Some Basic programming, vim and bla bla.

#### Some Basics
These are some basics of software and programming.


#### Basic Design Principles
>1) Identify the aspects of your application that vary and 
separate (*encpsulate*) them from what stays the same.
>2) Program to an *Interface* not to an Implementation.
>3) Favour composition over inheritance. Has-A is better than Is-A relationship.


# Design Patterns

####Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
